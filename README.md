Project Description: Bank Statement Generator
This project implements a bank statement generator using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. It allows users to perform deposits and withdrawals, and generates a formatted statement reflecting all transactions with dates, credits, debits, and the running balance.

Key Features:
Deposit and Withdrawal Functionality: Users can deposit and withdraw funds from their account.

Statement Generation: The system generates a well-formatted statement showing all transactions in chronological order.

TDD Approach: The project is developed using TDD, with unit tests for individual behaviors (deposits, withdrawals, and statement formatting) and an integration test to verify the full workflow.

Technologies:
- Java: Core implementation language.

- JUnit: For writing and running unit tests.

- Mockito: For mocking dependencies in tests (if applicable).

Testing Strategy:
- Unit Tests: Verify individual behaviors (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, and statement formatting).

- Integration Test: Ensures the system works as a whole, combining deposits, withdrawals, and statement generation.

How to Run:
1- Clone the repository.

2- Run the tests using your preferred IDE or build tool (e.g., Maven/Gradle).

3- Explore the implementation and test cases to understand the TDD workflow.
